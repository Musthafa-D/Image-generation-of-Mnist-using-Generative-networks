# MNIST Image Generation Using Generative Networks (PyTorch)

## Project Overview

This project implements **image generation** on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset using generative neural networks in PyTorch.  
The objective is to learn the underlying data distribution and generate realistic handwritten digit images from random noise.

MNIST is a standard benchmark dataset for both classification and generative modeling tasks.

This repository provides scripts for training generative models, visualizing the generated images and interpretability methods of the generative models.

## Dataset

- **MNIST**
- 60,000 training images, 10,000 test images
- 28×28 grayscale handwritten digits (0–9)

Both gans and conditional gans are implemented.
